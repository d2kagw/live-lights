# Live Lights

My custom, work-in-progress implementation of [Ambilight](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=ambilight).

Unlike many other implementations, this project doesn't rely on XMBC or video playing through a computers media player (although does require a computer to parse and process data).

There's a few extra features packed in too:
* Different modes:
  * Single Colour: just one colour, selected via IR
  * Colour Cycle: Slowly cycle through the colour spectrum
  * Disco Mode: Various patterns, strobes and colours (ideally music triggered - but that's for another day)
  * Dynamic Movie Mode: Each LED gets it's own colour based on local colour and brightness
  * Ambient Movie Mode: All LEDs get a colour to represent the colour temperature of the scene on TV
* Wireless "Surround Light" modules to help light the room with ambient light, away from the TV
